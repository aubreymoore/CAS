Hafa Adai,

I am Aubrey Moore, the extension entomologist at the University of Guam.

I am joined by a small live audience of UOG colleagues consisting of:

* Else Demeulenaere
* Jim McConnell
* Roland Quitugua
* Jesse Bamba
* Olympia Terral
* Bob Bevacqua

# Introduction of Dr. Ronald Cave

It is my pleasure to introduce [Dr. Ronald Cave](https://irrec.ifas.ufl.edu/directory/faculty/cave/). Ron grew up in California. He was a Peace Corps volunteer in El Salvador and Paraguay, and worked for 15 years at the Panamerican School of Agriculture in Honduras. Ronald D. Cave joined the University of Florida in 2002 where he is currently Director of the Indian River Research and Education Center (IRREC). His research program focuses on biological control of invasive arthropods - particularly the importation of exotic insects as candidate biological control agents, assessment of commercial natural enemies, and study of the biology of parasitoids and predators. He has worked extensively on biocontrol of *Aulacaspis yasumatsui*, also known as cycad aulacaspis scale or CAS for short. This tiny scale insect is responsible for killing about 96% of Guam's endemic cycad population.

As you probably know, *Cycas micronesica*, known locally as fadang, was placed on the US Threatened and Engangered species list in 2015, which places it a protected status under the US Fish and Wildlife Service. I would like to thank Toni Mizerek and Mike Richardson of the Fish and Wildlife Service for sponsoring Ron's trip to Guam to help us plan for recovery of fadang.

# House Keeping

This Zoom session is being recorded and the recording will be made publicly available on the web.

Following Ron's talk, I will give a short presentation on CAS biocontrol on Guam.

This will be followed by open discussion for all where you can ask questions and provide comments.

Please remain muted until the open discussion starts. I will be monitoring the chat in case you want to comment using that facility.
