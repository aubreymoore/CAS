  abstract = {Scale-infested cycad leaves were sampled on the island of Guam in a wide range of habitats in 2017 and 2018 to determine the extent of parasitoid control of the scale. The sampling unit was a leaflet selected from five trees per habitat during each sampling date. The number of scales were counted with a hand lens and parasitoids were reared in a growth chamber at 60\% relative humidity. Infested leaflets were transferred to new rearing vessels after 48 hour intervals and returned to the growth chamber. Insects were rinsed with 70\% EtOH and parasitoids were counted with the aid of a microscope. The abaxial leaflet surfaces harbored greater numbers of scale than the adaxial surfaces. In a Northern Guam site where parasitoids were first fortuitously discovered in 2013, only 20\% of the samples yielded parasitoids. For each geographic site, the presence of parasitoids on one sampling date did not always lead to evidence of parasitoids at a later sampling date. The number of parasitized scales was minimal despite the widespread geographic occurrence of the parasitoids. Several native and exotic Cycas cycad species were historically heavily used in the commercial and residential landscapes of Guam, and the recent invasion of the cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS) Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi has devastated these cycad populations. These results provide the first evidence that scale parasitoids are established throughout most of the island, but they are not effectively controlling the scale infestations. This case study is an example of how the horticulture profession can aid in responding to an ecological disaster.},

Few studies have considered the actual mechanisms by which crawlers disperse, and although crawlers are capable of actively wandering over short distances (generally {$<$} 1 m), their dispersal over longer distances has been thought to be wind-mediated. Here, we present evidence of a potentially more important means of dispersal over longer distances ({$>$} 1 m). We first confirmed that crawlers of four species of Diaspididae [Abgrallaspis aguacatae Evans, Watson \& Miller; Hemiberlesia lataniae (Signoret); Aspidiotus nerii Bouché; and Diaspidiotus perniciosus (Comstock)] have four hairs on the end of each of their legs and that each of these hairs ends in a suction cup-like structure, reminiscent of the attachment structures possessed by phoretic mites. In a controlled environment, using crawlers of A. nerii, we then showed that the crawlers use these structures to attach themselves to three different insect species [Musca domestica L., Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant and Linepithema humile (Mayr)] and can effectively be moved phoretically by these insects. Crawlers can remain attached to flying insects for considerable periods of time, suggesting that this may be an important means of dispersal for armored scale insects. The importance of phoresy for diaspidid dispersal in the field remains to be determined.},

The small size of this cycad pest and complex surface morphology of the host cycad organs combine to make visual detection of every cryptic infestation difficult or impossible to achieve. The international movement of Cycas revoluta Thunb. nursery plants and the presence of C. revoluta nursery industries in so many countries have enabled this pest to wreak havoc on the international cycad horticulture trade over the last 25 years. The short pre-oviposition period and considerable female fecundity lead to rapid population expansion on the plants initially infested in newly invaded regions. A depletion of non-structural carbohydrates accompanies long-term infestations and precedes plant death. Enemy escape within the invasive range allows the scale population growth to remain unchecked until anthropogenic efforts establish non-native biological control.},

To more fully understand how A. yasumatsui has threatened the host cycad species, we determined the microstrobilus size and number of pollinators per microstrobilus from 2001 to 2021. The microstrobilus height and diameter were measured directly, and the volume was calculated. Microstrobili were 58 cm in height, 13 cm in diameter, and 4740 cm3 in volume prior to direct A. yasumatsui infestations. Microstrobili decreased in size immediately after direct infestations by A. yasumatsui, and then began to slowly increase in size until 2021. For example, the volume was 24\% of pre-invasion volume in 2007, and was 57\% of pre-invasion volume in 2021. Microstrobili were harvested; then, the number of pollinator pupae were counted after an incubation period. Pollinator pupae counts per microstrobilus declined to 66\% of pre-invasion levels by 2007 and have remained similarly constrained through 2021. Our results revealed that A. yasumatsui damage to the host C. micronesica population is not limited to attrition of the extant plant population, but also includes a loss in male reproductive effort and the risk of coextinction of the insular pollinator.},

Stem height, basal diameter and leaf number were also measured for each plant and used to determine density, demography and allometric relationships. Allometric traits and a left-skewed demographic structure of the pre-invasion C. micronesica habitat documented a thriving population with high recruitment potential. Aulacaspis yasumatsui dispersed into the study site 4 mo after the initial census. All seedlings were killed within 9 mo and all juvenile plants were killed within 40 +/- 10 mo. Mortality reached 92\% by 6 y after chronic scale infestations. Allometry and demography of the 2011 survivors described a collapsing C. micronesica population of stressed and reproductively challenged trees with no recruitment. This classic example of the enemy release hypothesis has resulted in a homogeneous decline in plant density from 2007-2011.

Second, tree-winching and three-point bend stress tests revealed the natural resistance to damage from tropical cyclones has been compromised by the chronic feeding of this homopteran pest. Third, no typhoon event has occurred since the arthropod’s invasion and its spread in the year 2005 to actually test extent of mechanical failure for the unhealthy remaining trees. Fourth, historical records indicate the probability that Guam will experience typhoon force winds is 0.51 in three years and 0.91 in 10 y. These four factors integrate to predict the next typhoon may eliminate the surviving C. micronesica trees and stewardship of this declining population requires intervention to counter this prediction.},

Seedling mortality was 100\% by 2006, juvenile mortality was 100\% by 2014, and the 2020 census revealed 96\% mortality of the plant population. Localities in western Guam and isolated forest fragments exhibited the greatest mortality, with 100\% extirpation from two fragmented western localities. The juvenile and mature trees in Yap were unchanged from 2010 to 2018, but the seedling count was heterogeneous among the years. Constrained recruitment from seedlings to juveniles explained these dynamics. Yap transects contained about 6120 seedlings, 3400 juveniles, and 1250 mature plants per ha. Biological control of the invasive insects remains the acute conservation action needed for the Guam population. Lessons learned may be useful in other regions where invasions of non-native pests threaten biodiversity.},

Hill populations. The predator demonstrated a clear preference for A. yasumatsui infesting adult plants, resulting in 100\% seedling mortality due to the lack of a biocontrol of the scale on seedlings. A Y-tube olfactometer was employed to determine if scale-infested seedling leaves were less attractive to R. lophanthae than scale-infested mature tree leaves. Five paired combinations of seedling versus mature tree leaves were used. The R. lophanthae adults navigated toward scale-infested and un-infested leaves of adults and seedlings when paired with an empty chamber. However, a clear preference for adult leaves occurred when paired with seedling leaves. The results were unambiguous in charcoal-filtered air, intermediate in unfiltered air from an open laboratory, and most ambiguous when conducted with unfiltered in-situ air. The number of predators that did not make a choice was greatest for in-situ air and least for charcoal-filtered air. These results indicated that the substrate used in olfactometry influenced the results, and interpretations of charcoal-filtered air assays should be made with caution. Volatile chemical cues are involved in R. lophanthae preferring A. yasumatsui located on C. micronesica adults when infested adult and seedling leaves are present.},

Hill trees and used for asexual propagation to more fully understand resource factors that influence adventitious root formation success. Healthy source trees had received insecticide protection from ubiquitous Aulacaspsis yasumatsui Takagi infestations and unhealthy source trees had suffered from chronic A. yasumatsui infestations. Nonstructural carbohydrates were quantified from stem tissues at the base of each 1-m cutting, and induction of adventitious roots was attempted using field soil as the medium. Carbohydrate concentrations were increased in healthy, protected tree cuttings above those in unhealthy, infested tree cuttings. The relative increase was greatest in the hexoses, intermediate in sucrose, and least in starch. The total nonstructural carbohydrate concentration in cuttings of infested trees was 54\% of that of protected trees, and the sugar/starch quotient of infested trees exceeded that of protected trees. Asexual propagation success was 30\% for the unhealthy tree cuttings and 100\% for the healthy tree cuttings. These manipulative experiments confirm that chronic A. yasumatsui herbivory of C. micronesica trees reduces stem carbohydrates and decreases asexual propagation success. The results indicate that the use of large cuttings from unhealthy C. micronesica trees to rescue tree populations from construction sites is not a wise conservation decision in habitats where A. yasumatsui herbivory has been uncontrolled. Protocols for future rescue operations designed to transplant C. micronesica trees from construction sites may be improved by this new knowledge.},

Dihammus marianarum infestations reached ephemeral maximum and minimum levels ≈2 years after A. yasumatsui infestations reached maximum and minimum levels. Erechthias sp. infestations disappeared in early 2006 when Cycas micronesica leaves were being killed by acute A. yasumatsui infestations. Erechthias sp. infestations increased thereafter as A. yasumatsui incidence declined in response to biological control. Chilades pandava infestations appeared to increase and decrease inversely with A. yasumatsui infestations throughout the years. Aulacaspis yasumatsui may be indirectly affecting D. marianarum damage by direct control of changes in overall tree health. Aulacaspis yasumatsui may be indirectly influencing Erechthias sp. through direct control over leaf longevity.

The carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus stoichiometry beneath the cycad plants significantly diverged from those of the adjacent native forests with Pisonia grandis, Psychotria mariana, Aglaia mariannensis, Cynometra ramiflora, and Ficus sp. cover after five years. Mineralization traits were determined beneath nine-year-old C. micronesica plants and revealed the plants greatly increased net nitrification and decreased net ammonification when compared to the native forest soils with Bursera simaruba, Pinus elliottii, and Quercus virginiana cover. These flux changes increased the total available nitrogen and percent available nitrogen in the soils beneath the cycad plants. The substrates of two soil series exhibited increased carbon and nitrogen concentrations beneath Z. integrifolia plants when compared with soils away from the cycad plants. No other mineral or metal was influenced by proximity to the Z. integrifolia plants. These gymnosperms exhibit distinct interactions with their subtending soils, and some of these traits improve ecosystems by increasing recalcitrant carbon and nitrogen and increasing spatial heterogeneity of soil chemistry.},

This project estimated the density of C. micronesica remaining in the inaccessible cliff lines of northwestern, northern, and northeastern Guam and assessed their current health status using 80 aerial photographs of the cliff line perimeter of northern Guam in April 2007. There were 6537 C. micronesica counted in the photographs, resulting in a density of 0.8 trees/ha. Of these, 2160 (33\%) exhibited leaf yellowing, drooping leaves, or defoliation characteristic of A. yasumatsui infestation while healthy trees appeared green and vigorous. There were no statistically significant differences between the numbers of trees in the western, northern and eastern cliff line areas sampled, although there were fewer trees observed in the eastern sector. There were significant differences in the distribution of healthy trees between the western, northern and eastern cliff line areas, with a greater proportion of healthy trees found in the west and north than in the eastern cliff line area. Differences among sites may be related to differences in rainfall, with trees on the dryer leeward western and northern sites being scattered throughout the cliff line area while trees on the wetter windward eastern site appeared clustered on the lower rocky flats above the seacoast. Differences may also be due to differences in the density of the coccinellid predator, Rhyzobius lophanthae, in this remote area of Guam.}

  abstract = {Abstract for a presentation at the~Western Forest Insect Work Conference, April 1, 2014. Biological Invasion of Forests on Guam and Other Islands in Micronesia Aubrey Moore Cooperative Extension Service / Western Pacific Tropical Research Center College of Natural and Applied Sciences University of Guam, Mangilao, Guam American affiliated island groups in Micronesia include the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia, which includes the states of Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae. As the name suggests, the 2,100 islands in Micronesia are small, with Guam being the largest at 212 square miles. Micronesia's forests are under severe attack from invasive species. The most important are: Ungulates. Pigs and deer were imported for food and caribao (water buffalo) were imported as beasts of burden during colonial times. Prior to WWII, these ungulates were not a problem on Guam because populations were controlled by human hunters. However, access to hunters was denied on most of the one-third of Guam land occupied by the U.S. military. Subsequently, in the absence of predation from natural enemies, ungulate populations have become very high, destroying much of the native forest. Brown treesnake (BTS), Boiga irregularis. Guam's avifauna was extirpated by BTS which arrived shortly after WWII. Cascading effects include loss of ecosystem services provided by birds and other vertebrates such as seed dispersal, insectivory and pollination. Extirpation of birds and other vertebrate insectivores by BTS predation has resulted in high populations of herbivorous invertebrates in Guam's forests. Cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS), Aulacaspis yasumatsui. The infestation of this armored scale was first detected on ornamental cycads on Guam in the fall of 2003 but it rapidly spread to Guam' s wild, endemic Cycas micronesica population and later to wild cycads in the CNMI and Palau. This is a classic case of 'escape from natural enemies'. Plant mortality from the scale infestation was so severe that C. micronesica was placed on the IUCN list of threatened species in 2005. Only three years prior, in 2002, a forest survey found C. micronesica to be the most numerous tree in Guam's forests. This plant is still under attack by CAS and several other recently arrived invasive species. Mortality exceeds 90\% in some forest plots and there is no reproduction. Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros. CRB was first detected in Palau just after WWII and on Guam in 2007. Coconut palms, listed as Guam's second most numerous tree in a 2002 forest survey, can be killed by adults which bore into the crowns to feed on sap. Following a failed attempt to eradicate CRB, efforts on Guam are now aimed at developing integrated pest management. Little fire ant (LFA), Wasmannia auropunctata. LFA was first detected on Guam in 2011 at about a dozen distinct sites. LFA devastates the forest by killing wildlife and other arthropods, except for phytophagous hemipterans which are protected in return for honey dew. To date, funds and other resources have not been identified to eradicate or otherwise control this pest. A major impediment to controlling forest pests in Guam and the rest of Micronesia is a lack of professional capacity. During the past 20 years, the number of PhD level entomologists and plant pathologists practicing in the region has declined from 9 to 3 and from 4 to 1, respectively. During this same period, detections of invasive species affecting forestry and agriculture have increased greatly as a result of globalization and relaxed biosecurity. Coupled with 'the taxonomic impediment', these factors have lead to a gross under-reporting of impacts of invasive species in Micronesia.},

  abstract = {Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a US Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90\% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. OrNV unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for CRB on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with CRB. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the CRB which invaded Guam belong to an OrNV resistant biotype named CRB-G which is involved in all recent invasions of CRB in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to CRB breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10\% and 38\%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these IPM failures will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Cycad aulacaspis scale (Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi (Hemiptera: Diaspididae)) is native to Thailand and Vietnam. Since the early 1990s it has been spreading around the world due to the trade in cycad plants for ornamental use. Infestation by this scale can kill cycads in only a few months. Its accidental introduction to Florida endangered the ornamental cycad-growing industry; and in Guam and Taiwan, endemic cycads (Cycas micronesica and C. taitungensis, respectively) are currently threatened with extinction by cycad aulacaspis scale. In November 2011, an introduced scale was discovered damaging cycads in the Bogor Botanic Garden. Samples from Bogor were taken for identification of the scale, and the material was kept for some time to rear out any insect parasitoids that were present. Both the scale insects and parasitoids were prepared on microscope slides and studied microscopically for authoritative identification. The scale was confirmed as A. yasumatsui. The parasitoid Arrhenophagus chionaspidis Aurivillius (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) and the hyperparasitoid Signiphora bifasciata Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Signiphoridae) were identified from the samples. Unless immediate remedial measures are taken, several endemic species of cycad in Indonesia may be endangered by infestation by cycad aulacaspis scale.},

  abstract = {Biological control is a key element in any management program to control the cycad aulacaspis scale, Aulacaspis ya-sumatsui Takagi. An overview of the natural enemies known to attack the scale is presented. Sixteen species of predatory lady beetles (Coccinellidae) have been collected on scale-infested cycads in south Florida. Chilocorus cacti (L.), Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant and Exochomus childreni childreni Mul-sant are frequently encountered, but do not suppress scale populations. Rhyzobius lophanthae (Blaisdell) is a voracious predator that reportedly provides good control of cycad aula-caspis scale in Hawaii, but has a sparse distribution on cycads in Florida. The minute predatory beetle Cybocephalus nippon-icus Endrödy-Younga is abundant and widespread throughout the eastern USA and contributes to limited scale mortality. The parasitic wasp Coccobius fulvus (Compere and Annecke) was introduced from Thailand into Florida in 1998, but has not been effective in controlling the pest. Overall parasitism in south Florida varies from 10 to 40\%. Arrhenophagus chionaspidis Aurivillius and Aprostocetus purpureus (Cameron) parasitize cycad aulacaspis scale throughout Southeast Asia and are cur-rently under study as potential biological control agents in Florida. Four commercially available entomopathogenic nema-todes were tested in the laboratory and all were observed in-fecting and killing female scales. No pathogens are known to cause disease in the cycad aulacaspis scale. Cycads, commonly called "sago palms", are highly desired by landscapers and homeowners because they are long-lived, require low maintenance, and are resistant to most pests. In 1995, a scale insect, Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi, also re-ferred to as the cycad aulacaspis scale (CAS), was discovered infesting cycads in the collection of the Montgomery Botani-cal Center in Coral Gables, Florida. Infestations of the scale were found to be particularly severe on Cycas spp. and Stange-ria eriopus (Kunze) Baillon (Howard et al . 1999). This pest pro-duces dense populations on the leaves, fruits, and trunk, resulting in premature death of leaves which can reduce plant longevity. Cycas revoluta Thunberg (the king sago), the most popular of ornamental cycads, is particularly susceptible to the scale; many plants throughout Florida and the Caribbean have died as a result of this pest.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The fruit fly Drosophila suzukii, or spotted wing Drosophila (SWD), has become a serious pest world‐wide attacking many soft‐skinned fruits. An efficient monitoring system that identifies and counts SWD in crops and their surroundings is therefore essential for integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. Existing methods, such as catching them in liquid bait traps and manually counting them, are costly, time‐consuming, and labour‐intensive. To overcome these limitations, we studied insect trap monitoring through image‐based object detection with deep learning. RESULTS Based on an image database with 4753 annotated SWD flies, we trained a ResNet‐18‐based deep convolutional neural network to detect and count them, including sex prediction and discrimination. The results show that SWD can be detected with an area under the precision recall curve (AUC) of 0.506 (female) and 0.603 (male), in digital images taken from a static position. For images collected by a flying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the algorithm detected SWD individuals with an AUC of 0.086 (female) and 0.284 (male). The lower AUC for the aerial imagery was caused by lower image quality as a result of the stabilization manoeuvres of the UAV during image collection. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that it is possible to monitor SWD with deep learning and object detection. Moreover, they demonstrate the potential for UAVs to monitor insect traps which could be valuable for the development of autonomous insect monitoring systems and IPM.

  abstract = {Theoretical and empirical evidence developed in four subdisciplines of biological control (biocontrol of plant pathogens, weeds, nematodes, and arthropods) is brought to bear upon a shared question: the significance of intraguild predation. Intraguild predation ("IGP") occurs when two species that share a host or prey (and therefore may compete) also engage in a trophic inter-action with each other (parasitism or predation). We describe the prevalence of IGP and its role in the population dynamics of biological-control agents and target pests. IGP is a widespread interaction within many, but not all, communities of biological-control agents. IGP appears to be pervasive among communities of control agents associated with nematode or arthropod pests. Common forms of IGP include pathogens that infect both herbivores and parasitoids of the herbivore; facultative hyperparasitoids, which can parasitize either an herbivore or a primary parasitoid of the herbivore; predators that attack herbivores that harbor a developing parasitoid; and predators that attach each other. In contrast, IGP appears to be relatively uncommon among biological-control agents of plant pathogens because trophic interactions are less important than competition or antibiosis. Likewise, biological-control agents of weeds interact primarily through competition alone because host ranges are mostly restricted to plant taxa. Empirically based simulation models and general analytical models of interactions involving arthropod pathogens or facultative hyperparasitoids yield variable and often conflicting predictions for the influence of IGP on the success of biological control. Models for predator-predator interactions, however, consistently predict that IGP disrupts biological control. All the field-documented cases of IGP leading to disruption of biological control stem from studies of predators, including mites, insects, and predatory fishes. IGP between two predators or between a predator anti an adult parasitoid does not require mortality of the shared prey/host (i.e., the target pest); thus, IGP can be intense, resulting in high levels of mortality for one or both of the natural enemies, while the total mortality imposed on the target pest population is minimal. For this reason, we hypothesize that IGP by predators is particularly likely to influence the efficacy of biological control. Our ability to develop successful programs of biological control will be enhanced by field studies that address the complexity of trophic interactions occurring in agroecosystems. There is a critical need for additional manipulative experiments conducted in the field that test not only population ecology theory for two-species interactions, but also community ecology theory for multispecies interactions.},

  abstract = {The monitoring of insect pests based on adult trapping systems is part of integrated pest management (IPM) in many crops and of early warning detection programs used to set up appropriate management decisions or eradication responses. Using data obtained from traps to make management decisions is not an easy task and involves significant costs in equipment, transport and labour. Thanks to the spread and the low prices of information and communication technologies, innovative automated capture devices including electronic sensors and connecting components are increasingly being developed, allow facing some of the current monitoring constrains in a context of IPM. In this paper, we illustrated the state of the art of this field and provide insights on automated devices, consisting of traps equipped with sensors and other components for the collection of data in the field and their transmission to a remote server accessible online, with information stored in geo-referenced databases. Optical sensors are mainly used for detecting photo-interruptions, images or optoacoustic spectrum of wingbeats. The monitoring systems can be equipped with software for image interpretation and identification of the caught target insect pest (fully automated system) or a remote operator can count the trapped insects by watching the images coming from the e-trap (semi-automated system). The software can integrate a decision support system (DSS) module, which provides information on the risk of infestation and the actions to be taken (when, where, how to make a control application). The development and future prospects of automated devices are discussed in relation to the technical reliability of the system, ease of use and costs compared to traditional monitoring methods.},
